# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple rock, paper, scissors game played in the browser console with the computer as your opponent. Part of the Foundations course at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

This project demonstrates an understanding of JavaScript basics including if/else conditional statements, function parameters, variable scope, comparison and increment operators, and string methods. I used pseudo code to write out the logic for this game before beginning to code.

To play, open your browser console and visit the [live demo](https://daniellebartel.github.io/rock-paper-scissors).
